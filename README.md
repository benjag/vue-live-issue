# vue-live-bug

There seems to be an issue with latest version of Vue `3.3.x` and vue-live. I've reproduced this in a vanilla vue/vite app.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
